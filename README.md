# OSRS Pathfinder Prototype Frontend

This is a fork of https://github.com/mejrs/mejrs.github.io which features a client-side rendered Webapplication of RS3 and OSRS maps.

All RS3 maps and most of their data has been removed.

The OSRS map has been extended with pathfinding capabilities using the Pathfinder backend.

# Usage

Go to the [backend project](https://github.com/OlZe/osrs_pathfinder) which includes this frontend as a git submodule and serves the files
